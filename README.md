# CS 3366 Project 1: Elevator Interface

My project is designed based on the Library stacks elevator as shown below.

### Uses of the elevator

The most common use of an elevator interface:

* Requesting the elevator to go to another floor.
* Holding open the doors.
* Closing the doors early.

The less frequent use of an elevator is the call for assistance button.


### The good

* The buttons are well spaced. The main buttons are clearly separated from the bottom three buttons.
* Each button has a clear label that lets you know where it will send you.
* The buttons provide feedback through a audible ding and a lit indicator after pressing the button.

### The bad

* The assistance button is off center.
* Labels are unclear. What does S stand for? People may not know which button opens or closes the elevator doors.
* The cards on the side can be easily tampered or switched.
* The cards on the side are not blind-friendly (no braille).

## The Redesign

Three changes were made:

* The cards and labels were merged to make each button's purpose more clear.
* Additional information on the labels for the assistance and open/close doors buttons.
* The button at the bottom was centered.

The following sketch was made before moving my project to processing.
