        <h1 id="cs-3366-project-2-magic-mirror">CS 3366 Project 2: Magic Mirror</h1>
        <p>I began my project by sketching out the following design.</p>
        <img src="docs/sketch.JPG"/>
        <p>As the image (and my handwriting) may be unclear, let me explain. I have the mirror split into 3 types: widgets, information, and standby button.</p>

        <h2>Widgets</h2>
        <p>In my design, I included widgets for news, calendar, weather, texts, social feed, and exercises.</p>

        <h3>News</h3>
        <p>
            For news, the news should be pulled from either a JSON file or an API such as NewsAPI. I elected to use a JSON file. 
            Within the widget, I display the title followed by a line divisor to create space.
            I pull the latest three stories and their publisher. The publisher is in a darker color to create contrast with the story title.
            This allows me to list multiple stories without the need for horizontal dividers.</p>

        <h3>Calendar</h3>
        <p>
            For the calendar, I chose to only display events that were occurring that day. The thought was that it could be used to seee what is on my agenda for the day.
            Each entry displays the title of the event and the time in which the event is going to occur.
            The time is displayed in a darker font to allow the user to focus on the title more. 
        </p>

        <h3>Weather</h3>
        <p>
            The weather is pulled from Weahter.gov's free API. This API provides a bunch of information but I only wanted the forecast for today, and the highs/lows for the next three days.
            The top half of the widget provides today's weather as that is the most important for the user. There is also an icon that is supposed to correspond with the weather for today.
            In the bottom half, I display the highs and lows for the next three days. 
            Similar to previous widgets, the detailed forecast, and the lows are in a darker color as to let the user focus on other elements.
        </p>

        <h3>Texts</h3>
        <p>
            In the sketch, I planned on displaying a small message icon (speech bubble) by the latest unread text.
            Had I implemented this onto the final mirror, I would have the message in a darker color to create contrast.
        </p>

        <h3>Social Feed</h3>
        <p>
            For the social feed, I simply wanted to show the latest notifications from the user's choice of social media.
        </p>

        <h3>Exercises</h3>
        <p>
            For exercises, I wanted to show what exercises that should be completed for the day based on a preset plan by the user.
        </p>


        <h2>Information</h2>
        <p>
            There are 4 pieces of information around the mirror. 
            On the top, you can see the current time. 
            On the bottom we have the time spent on the mirror, your current weight (and delta from last session), and your total sleep for last night.
        </p>

        <h2>Button</h2>
        <p>
            The last bit included on the mirror is the standby button next to the time.
            This button is for when a user wishes to not see any of the widgets and instead requires a light source.
            When the button is pressed, the user can select a color to display on the lights around.
        </p>
